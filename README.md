# IoT & Software Development | Xpert Internship (May 2025 - Jul 2025)

This project was part of my internship at **Xpert, Kolkata**, under the Career Development Centre.  
The goal was to design **low-power IoT hardware** and build a **robust speech-processing pipeline** for offline transcription and intelligent cloud integration.

## 🚀 Highlights
- ⚡ **Low-power hardware**: Designed ESP32 + microphone circuits with PCB design & VAD activation, reducing power usage by **35%**.
- 🎙️ **Speech pipeline**: Built noise reduction & diarization modules using Python (band-pass filtering, VAD, signal normalization).
- 🤖 **AI integration**: Improved transcription recall by **18%** with Whisper + Pyannote diarization.
- ☁️ **Cloud automation**: Integrated AWS for storage + authentication, enabling automated workflows.
- 🏷️ **Smart tagging**: Developed auto-tagging module with **82% precision** using LangFlow + OpenAI APIs.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Hardware**: ESP32, PCB design, 3D modeling  
- **Software**: Python, Whisper, Pyannote, AWS, LangFlow, OpenAI APIs  
- **Tools**: Fusion360, GitHub, Docker
